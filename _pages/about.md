I am currently a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning) at The University of Sheffield, working on probabilistic deep learning under the supervision of Dr Mauricio √Ålvarez. My current research interests include deep Gaussian processes and their applications, and the application of physical concepts to probabilistic machine learning. Previously I completed my MSc in Data Analytics (2020) and BSc in Physics (2018) at Sheffield, and worked in the energy sector for a year as an analyst at ENGIE UK.
