          "content": "I am currently a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at The University of Sheffield, working on probabilistic deep learning under the supervision of Dr Mauricio Álvarez. My current research interests include deep Gaussian processes and their applications, and the application of physical concepts to probabilistic machine learning. Previously I completed my MSc in Data Analytics (2020) and BSc in Physics (2018) at Sheffield, and worked in the energy sector for a year as an analyst at ENGIE UK. .
